# Predicting-human-migration-based-on-World-Happiness-Index
This is my final project completed within the last four weeks of my Data Science bootcamp wth AllWomen. My goal was to find out if World Happiness Reort can be useful in predicting human migration. For the project I used the World Happines Report wich also included a number of socio-economic variables, Net Migration report from the United Nations and the Migration Stock % from the World Bank. Eventually, I uded the Migration Stock % as a target of my prediction as it has proven to be more sutable. After joining all the data I had, I was left with a relatively small dataset containing 158 countries, each of them apearing in the dataset three times or less. With such a small sample I was not expecting very high accuracy but I assumed that if the accuracy of the model was more than 60% it could be concluded that the World Happiness Repot can be useful in predicting human migration.
